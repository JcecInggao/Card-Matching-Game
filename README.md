# Card-Matching-Game
A memory card matching game

- This projects goal is to get more familiar with Javascript and getting the Javascript to affect the HTML page.
- Like any memory type card game, your goal is to match up all the facedown cards with the current card.
- This game also keeps tracks of how many cards you have already flipped.
- Once all the cards have been matched, you win.
- You can then reset the game and try again.
